;; ## The Basics
;; ---

;; ***Gloss is a DSL for describing byte formats.***
;;
;; In Gloss a byte format is called a *frame*, frames are compiled into *codec*, which allow you to:
;;
;; - encode a data structure into a ByteBuffer<sup>1</sup>; or,
;; - decode a ByteBuffer into a data structure.
;;
;; A frame is just a clojure data structure. That data structure might include other codec, meaning a
;; complicated codec can be built from several smaller, simple codec.
;;
;; Defining codec by their composite parts allows testing (and transformation if needed) at a granular level.
;;
;; <sup>1 technically Gloss encodes/decodes sequences of ByteBuffers</sup>
